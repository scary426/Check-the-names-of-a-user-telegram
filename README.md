This is a tool for programmers only because it is a starting structure only, the scan is done by sending requests to the username connection to verify that it is available and sends a request to you that the username is available, but many attempts can lead to flooding for 15 minutes, but it is very useful for anyone who wanted to start programming Telegram tools and does not know where to start, it can be integrated into the auto bot, and the bot receives available usernames and installs them until the feature period expires, which is from 15 minutes to 20 minutes, and then it is reserved and can be made to scan through tokens bot to avoid flood ban
